# SolidStatePhysicsProject
Solid State Physics

#Rough draft
Our goal is to  learn and implement the Kwant python package in order to model and analyze solid state physics phenomena.


Proposal:

For this project, we are planning on using the python package kwant to help model solid state physics phenomena. In terms of which specific phenomena, we were considering relatively simple/basic behavior such as the tight binding and free electron models of conductivity, as well as maybe introducing a periodic potential to show how that changes the behavior further. If we found it feasible to take it even another step further, we would model this behavior for several different materials (encompassing both 2D and 3D materials),

In terms of the actual models/simulations, we would likely illustrate the wavefunctions for each model and respective material, as well as probability distributions and the paths taken by each electron. We would also plot the dispersion relations for each case, sample reciprocal lattices from a single reciprocal lattice plane family and the accompanying Brillouin zones for each material.

Our Core Goals will be as follows:

Get into code the basic setup for illustrating the free electron and tight binding models.

Make this code able to accommodate and properly represent the behavior for several 2D and 3D materials.

Plot the wavefunctions, probability distributions, dispersion relatiosn and electron paths for each case.

Illustrate sample reciprocal lattices and the accompanying Brillouin Zones.

Polish the code to make it more user-friendly and informative to those new to the subject of such phenomena.
